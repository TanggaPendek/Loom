migrate to singal
testing is pending
certain might require manual testing for check it working or not
frontend need high attention
using the .env for standarize main variable
implementing new and more basic node to be use


next todo is the edge add and delete then do the finish signal

next in line is to fix the node (value update,move) and edge frontend.. 
then do the backend frontend update (the "logs"/print) and event return like done (now can simply do without websocket.. 
just need to await update from backend (no async) but need to add stop/force ftop)
also nice to reduce  terminal clutter..


new bug -
 add does not add new node (need refresh),
 refresh does not update the node value(the value changed in the savefile),
 the run  utton flashing only even when the actual programm took a few sec (suspected the async response)
unfinish feature - 
 the logs, 
 stop and force stop engine is not working properly.. (suspected the engine + venv structure problem but not sure yet)
 updating noed value does nothing(for now only changing by properties bar + enter work, even onblur not working yet)..


 new bug -
    everything converted to string, and parsing to different type is problematic
need to fix next -
    the logs and fix button also fix a bit on api..
