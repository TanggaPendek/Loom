migrate to singal
testing is pending
certain might require manual testing for check it working or not
frontend need high attention
using the .env for standarize main variable
implementing new and more basic node to be use


next todo is the edge add and delete then do the finish signal

next in line is to fix the node (value update,move) and edge frontend.. 
then do the backend frontend update (the "logs"/print) and event return like done (now can simply do without websocket.. 
just need to await update from backend (no async) but need to add stop/force ftop)
also nice to reduce  terminal clutter..
