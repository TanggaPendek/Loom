# Proposed Basic Nodes

This document lists the foundational nodes to be implemented in the `nodebank/builtin` directory.

## Math Nodes
- **Add**: Takes two numbers and returns their sum.
- **Subtract**: Takes two numbers and returns their difference.
- **Multiply**: Takes two numbers and returns their product.
- **Divide**: Takes two numbers and returns their quotient.

## Logic Nodes
- **AND**: Returns true if both inputs are true.
- **OR**: Returns true if at least one input is true.
- **NOT**: Returns the inverse of the input boolean.
- **IF**: Conditional node that returns one of two values based on a boolean input.

## String Nodes
- **Concatenate**: Joins two or more strings together.
- **Split**: Splits a string into a list based on a delimiter.
- **Replace**: Replaces occurrences of a substring within a string.
- **Length**: Returns the number of characters in a string.

## Utility Nodes
- **Print**: Logs the input value to the console/signal hub.
- **Delay**: Pauses execution for a specified duration.
- **Constant**: Outputs a fixed value (number, string, boolean).
